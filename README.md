- 👋 Hi, I’m Olin
- 👀 I’m interested in embedded systems using FPGAs and PIC microcontrollers to build retro style video games using modern hardware. I use Labcenter Proteus to design 
- and simulate hardware and software and them layout the PCBs. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning VHDL and hardware design using Quartus 2 and the MAX 7000 CPLDs
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on retro style video games using PIC microcontrollers and Altera(Intel) FPGAs
